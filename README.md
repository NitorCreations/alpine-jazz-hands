# alpine-jazz-hands
Docker image for building alpine (apk) packages for your alpine repo. It's easy and nice, and everyone can do it.

# Intro
If you have been using docker for a while, you may be getting sick of the massive ubuntu/debian/centos docker images.
Alpine is small and nimble, but it may not have all the packages you want.

With this project, you can build your own packages!
